##  Project Structure

### 1.  Data Collection

The raw data was sourced from a mock retail database comprising multiple tables including:
- Transactions
- Products
- Stores
- Customers

### 2.  Data Cleaning
Performed using the script: [`data_cleaning.sql`](./data_cleaning.sql)

Key steps:
- Handled nulls and inconsistent formats

### 3. Data Analysis
Performed using: [`data_analysis_final.sql`](./data_analysis_final.sql)

Key areas analyzed:
- Product-level performance
- Category-wise sales and orders
- Time-based sales patterns (month, week, day)
- Channel preference (Online, Instore, Phone Delivery)

### 4.  RFM Analysis
Performed using: [`rfm_analysis.sql`](./rfm_analysis.sql)

We calculated:
- Recency
- Frequency
- Monetary value

Used RFM scores to segment customers into buckets for retention strategies.

### 5.  360 Customer Table
Built using: [`360Tables.sql`](./360Tables.sql)

This included:
- Total orders
- Total revenue
- Discount usage
- Profit contribution
